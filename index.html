On January 14th, 2021, the New York Jets hired former San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh to be their next head coach. Saleh came into an organization that finished with a record of 2-14 the year prior and a defense that was below the league average. The Jets haven’t been to the playoffs since 2010, and even though they still haven’t gotten back to the postseason, the defense has massively improved. This was expected, given Saleh’s background, but between himself and Jets’ general manager Joe Douglas, they committed to making this team’s defense generational. New York has gone after defensive players early in the draft, taking CB Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner, DE Jermaine Johnson, and DE Will McDonald IV in the first round in the last few years. The Jets also added players through free agency and have used a lot of their $224.8 million salary cap on defense. In fact, three of their top four highest paid positions are on defense. Quinnen Williams, John Franklin-Myers, Carl Lawson, and C.J. Mosley are four of the five highest paid players on the team, and they’re all on defense.

<p>Joe Douglas wanted to recreate the winning culture that Robert Saleh helped build in San Francisco, and he was willing to spend on defense to make sure that could happen. It worked, with the Jets allowing the 4th-fewest total yards of any team in 2022. However, his commitment to defense may have been at the cost of the team’s offense. As of Week 13 of the 2023 NFL season, the Jets average the second-least yards per game. Richie Mollura, an influencer and content creator from Jets Media, an account that focuses on the Jets, had his own take on Joe Douglas’ off-season moves. “I think Joe Douglas has been putting a lot of emphasis on the offense in the off-season, but it just hasn’t worked in their favor,” said Mollura. According to TruMedia, the same team has the worst offensive EPA since 2000 (the database only tracks back to that year), and much of that blame can be attributed to the offensive line play.  </p>

 The team has actually used resources on bringing in some solid offensive linemen. However, injuries have been an issue for the team this year. They’ve used nearly 15 different offensive line combinations this season. It’s tough to blame a general manager for injuries, but the blame is in the fact that there was a lack of depth on the roster at this position. Two of their starting linemen, OT Mekhi Becton and OG Alijah Vera-Tucker, were first round picks that suffered season-ending injuries last season. Duane Brown, the other projected starting tackle, is 38 years old. There was always a chance that these injury concerns came back to haunt them, and it did. Vera-Tucker suffered another season-ending injury, and Brown has missed a significant amount of time. More resources needed to be put into depth, but they weren’t, and the results speak for themselves.<br> <br>

The way the Jets have distributed money on the offensive side of the ball, compared to the amount of production they’ve gotten from their highest-paid offensive players, may be the reason why a once-promising 2023 season turned into an utter disappointment for the team and its fans. <br> <br>

The biggest story of the off-season for the Jets was the acquisition of quarterback Aaron Rodgers from the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers is a future Hall-of-Famer, multi-time All-Pro, and former Super Bowl champion. The team agreed to pay Rodgers $37.5 million per year, with $75 million in guaranteed money. During the first game into the season, on the first drive, Rodgers went down just minutes into the game, tore his achilles, and was out indefinitely. This was the beginning of the end of the season for the team. <br> <br>

Quarterback Zach Wilson was slated to take over for Rodgers after he went down. Wilson was the team’s second-overall selection in 2021, and after two disappointing seasons, the decision was made to bring in a veteran quarterback, let Wilson sit behind him and learn for a season or two, then re-evaluate the situation. That plan was shot when Rodgers went down. Teams like the Indianapolis Colts and Cincinnati Bengals have lost their starting quarterback for the season, but they’re still winning games. Zach Wilson was thrown right back in and didn’t look any better than he had the years prior. This isn’t entirely his fault. He was supposed to sit for a season, but instead was right back in after one possession. A different veteran quarterback should have been brought in to serve as the backup to Aaron Rodgers, but the Jets’ staff decided not to make a move, and they destroyed their own season by doing so. <br> <br>

The team’s highest paid wide receiver, Allen Lazard, was brought in this past off-season on a $44 million contract spread across four years. Lazard played with Rodgers in Green Bay and was supposed to be the second-best receiver on this offense, opposite the Jets’ star playmaker, Garrett Wilson. Through the first year of his contract, he struggled with drops, and was even benched during the Jets’ Week 12 game against the Dolphins. Instead of being a threat, he’s the fourth-leading receiver on the team with just 290 receiving yards. “Maybe Allen Lazard is a player who plays his best with one of the greatest quarterbacks of this generation, Aaron Rodgers,” explained Mollura. On the same note, tight end C.J. Uzomah was signed to a three year contract with an average salary of $8 million. He’s the team’s highest paid tight end, but is ninth in receiving yards on the team with just 58. <br> <br>

A blend of not spending money, as well as spending money on the wrong things, has put the Jets in a spot where they went from a Super Bowl hopeful to being out of the playoff picture and focusing on next season, just like usual. <br> <br> <br>
